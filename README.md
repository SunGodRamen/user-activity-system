# Project: User Activity Tracking System
## Overview
The system will be responsible for collecting, processing, and storing user activity data in a web application. It's a common use-case in modern applications to track user behaviors to enhance features, provide recommendations, or monitor system usage.

## Components
User Service (Microservice)
- Manages user data.
- Exposes endpoints to create, update, delete, and retrieve user profiles.
- Uses Cassandra as its primary datastore due to its scalability and fault tolerance.

Activity Service (Microservice)
- Collects user activity data.
- Sends data to Kafka as events.
- Has an endpoint where frontend applications can send user activity data (e.g., login, page visits, button clicks).

Activity Processor (Microservice)
- Consumes messages from Kafka.
- Processes the raw data (like aggregating, filtering, or transforming data).
- Stores processed data in Cassandra.

API Gateway
- Serves as an entry point for frontend applications.
- Routes requests to the appropriate microservice.
- Can handle cross-cutting concerns like authentication, logging, etc.

## Flow
A user interacts with the web application.
The web application sends raw activity data to the Activity Service.
The Activity Service pushes this data into Kafka as events.
The Activity Processor consumes these events, processes the data, and stores the results in Cassandra.

## Implementation Steps:
- Set up Cassandra
    Create a keyspace for your project.
    Define tables for user profiles and processed activity data.

- User Service
    Create a Spring Boot application.
    Integrate with Cassandra using Spring Data Cassandra.
    Implement CRUD endpoints for user profiles.

- Activity Service
    Create another Spring Boot application.
    Set up a Kafka producer to send messages.
    Create an endpoint to collect user activity data and send it to Kafka.

- Activity Processor
    Create yet another Spring Boot application.
    Set up a Kafka consumer to receive messages.
    Process the data and store the results in Cassandra.

- API Gateway
    Use Spring Cloud Gateway or another API gateway solution.
    Route requests to either User Service or Activity Service based on the request path.

- Integrate Services
    Deploy all services (locally or on a cloud provider).
    Use a tool like Postman to send requests and test the flow.

- Extend the project
    Add error handling, logging, and monitoring.
    Implement user authentication and authorization.
    Use Spring Cloud Config for centralized configuration management.
    Add more advanced data processing in the Activity Processor, like generating daily user activity reports.
